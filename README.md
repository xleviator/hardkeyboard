# Hard Keyboard
Even more pretentious than dvorak. (proof of concept)

The keyboard layout alternates between QWERTY and DVORAK modes when the space key is pressed (or with every key press if hard mode is enabled).

If you are having trouble getting this to work, please enable the QWERTY and DVORAK layouts in system preferences.
